## Introduction

For this project, we were working with the [Office for Product Safety and Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-product-safety-and-standards) (OPSS) within the [Government Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy) (BEIS). As part of leaving the European Union, we were building a single replacement system for two European systems ([ICSMS](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/icsms/) and [RAPEX](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumers_safety/safety_products/rapex/alerts/repository/content/pages/rapex/index_en.htm)) that the UK currently shares with the EU. These systems allow UK regulators to carry out market surveillance activities and to make sure that dangerous or unsafe products are not being sold to consumers.

The system needed to collect and manage data on product safety and market surveillance from multiple sources and make that data available to UK regulators, enforcement bodies, businesses and consumers through appropriate channels. 

This was a big undertaking which warranted a big team and it was by far the largest team I had worked on at Softwire. Below is a list of the roles within our team and some of their responsibilities.

* 1 product owner
  * Liaising with stakeholders and prioritising development tasks
* 1 project manager
  * Handling project finances and resources and reporting on project progress
* 1 scrum master
  * Helping with the day-to-day running of the team and clearing obstacles
* 2 user researchers
  * Learning about the users through interviews and testing assumptions about how users interact with the service
* 2 service designers
  * Using research from user interviews to design the layout of the site
* 1 technical lead
  * Designing the system's infrastructure, unblocking developers and reviewing code
* 6 developers
  * Coding up the site from designs by the service designers
* 1 tester
  * Testing the site once it has been built to find bugs and flag them up to the developers

This team worked really well together, and I enjoyed the opportunity to work closely with people in different roles to get a better understanding of the work that goes on beyond developing the code for a project.

## Architecture

The frontend was written using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), a web application framework with a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. When users visit the site, they are first authenticated by [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), an Identity and Access Management provider before being granted access. The site pulled business information from the [Companies House API](https://developer.companieshouse.gov.uk/api/docs/) and stored data in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. We had a [Redis](https://redis.io/) job queue which was responsible for running jobs in the background, such as scanning files for viruses or sending emails, without slowing down the user's experience.  We used [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) to allow users to search and filter through the product and business data on our site.

![Architecture diagram](/img/mspsds/architecture.png)

All of these different components were set up in individual [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers and we used [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) to orchestrate our multi-container setup. This approach allowed us to separate out the different concerns making it easier to reason about and to debug individual components during development.


### Ruby on Rails
The benefits of Ruby on Rails are that it does a lot of the heavy lifting for you and helps you to build simple things very quickly. For example, it has an idea of _resources_ within your system, a collection of similar objects, such as users or product investigations. Once you have declared a resource, Rails will create routes allowing you to do all of the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Destroy). The routes that are generated are shown below for the _users_ resource.

{% highlight linenos %}
       Prefix Verb          URI Pattern                    Controller#Action
        users GET           /users(.:format)               users#index
              POST          /users(.:format)               users#create
     new_user GET           /users/new(.:format)           users#new
    edit_user GET           /users/:id/edit(.:format)      users#edit
         user GET           /users/:id(.:format)           users#show
              PATCH         /users/:id(.:format)           users#update
              PUT           /users/:id(.:format)           users#update
              DELETE        /users/:id(.:format)           users#destroy
{% endhighlight %}

The ability for Rails to take care of these tasks is sometimes called _RubyMagic_ and can be incredibly helpful. The downside is that the magic can be like a blackbox, making it very hard to debug problems and to understand what's happening under the hood. From my experience, Rails lets you build very quickly if you stay on their _happy path_ but when you want to implement more complex functionality it can become difficult and frustrating.


### Git Submodules

In this project we used [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to store other Git repositories inside our main repository as subdirectories. We used this for two of the Keycloak components, one for styling the Keycloak pages and another for enabling the SMS-authentication. For these components we forked existing third-party repositories and by including them as submodules we were able to work on them from within our project but to keep our Git commits separate.


## Key Features

### User Research

During this project there was a strong emphasis on user testing. This involved creating hypotheses about our users which were evaluated through regular rounds of user testing. The testing was normally carried out as one-to-one interviews between a user and a user researcher where the user was presented with a clickable prototype of our site.

Early on in the project the user researchers held a workshop for the team, teaching us how to sit in on these interviews and take notes effectively. They told us what to focus on and to only include objective observations and direct quotes so as not to bias the results with our own judgements. They also stressed that every member of the team should be involved with observing interviews as it was the best way to understand the user's perspective.


### GOV.UK Prototype Kit

The clickable prototypes used for user testing were built using the [GOV.UK prototype kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs). The kit uses the [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) templating language for Javascript to pass data into the prototype to help make it feel more realistic for the user. It also uses the [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) which is a collection of styles and design patterns which help to make all GOV.UK services look consistent.

This is a very powerful combination and means that it is extremely easy to build pages that are styled like the final product and that simulate passing data in a realistic way. Below is a page from the prototype along with some of the Nunjucks code that was used to generate it.

      ]), prodRows) %}
  {% endif %}

      {% set prodRows = (prodRows.push([
            { text: "Brand" },

      ]), prodRows) %}

                { text: "Model name" },
                { text: prod.modelName  }
      ]), prodRows) %}
  {% endif %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Pair Programming

While I was working on this project I was part of a team of 6 developers, all with varying amounts of experience. This allowed us to work in pairs on a regular basis and I found that it was a great way to learn. When I was working with more senior devs I was able to ask questions and develop my understanding of the system. 

When I was working with more junior devs, I had to explain how the code worked and discuss what approaches I thought we should take. This really made me think and helped me to solidify my own understanding of what was going on. I also found that we were able to work faster in pairs, to catch more bugs and to learn shortcuts and tools from each other.

### Inheritance

Ruby is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which meant that we were able to leverage OOP paradigms like inheritance and polymorphism. A key place where inheritance was particularly useful was the activity timeline. On the site we had pages for investigations into potentially unsafe products and it was important to have a clear audit trail for the investigations. 

![Audit Activities](/img/mspsds/auditActivities.png)

The activity timeline allowed the user to see everything related to the case, in chronological order. Every entry on the timeline was an `Activity` object, which itself was a subclass of the `ApplicationRecord` class, an [Active Record Model](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html#creating-active-record-models) from the Rails framework. 

Different types of activity then inherited from `Activity` such as `AuditActivity` and `CommentActivity` allowing them to share functionality around formatting, timestamping and displaying images. The next level down was for different types of `AuditActivity` classes, dealing with entities such as Businesses, Products or Investigations, which all had their own properties. Finally, for each of these entities we had different functionality for adding, updating and deleting them.

`class Activity < ApplicationRecord`

`class AuditActivity::Base < Activity`

`class AuditActivity::Investigation::Base < AuditActivity::Base`

`class AuditActivity::Investigation::Add < AuditActivity::Investigation::Base`

This inheritance pattern, shown above, allowed us to share as much code as possible for common features at each level, whilst still being able to have different functionality as an end result.

### Coding in the Open

As the client for this project was the UK Government we had to work to the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), a set of 18 criteria to help the government create and run  digital services. It’s used by individual departments and the Government Digital Service to check whether a service is good enough for public use.

I have enjoyed working on government projects and I feel like the criteria that have been set out are sensible targets to work towards. One that I particularly like is point #8: _Make all new source code open and reusable_. This principle has also been called [Coding in the Open](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/). The main ideas are that it encourages good practice, enables more collaboration and allows for better accountability as you are able to see where public money is being spent. 

The code for this project is in a public Github repo and you can find it [here](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-mspsds).


### Coveralls

One of the tools used on this project was [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/), which allowed us to see which parts of our codebase were not being covered by our tests. Coveralls integrates really well with Github and we had it set up so that pull requests could only be approved if the test coverage was the same or greater than before. This enforced best practice around writing tests and allowed us to have more confidence in our codebase. 

![Coveralls integration with Github](/img/mspsds/coverallsWithGithub.png)

At the time of writing, the code coverage is at 96.843% and below is a graph showing the total number of lines of code and the number of covered lines as a function of time for our staging environment. 

![Test coverage over time](/img/mspsds/testCoverage.png)

### Show and Tell

As part of this project I presented the site at a Show and Tell meeting at the Office for Product Safety and Standards in Birmingham. This was a great opportunity for me to explain what we were building and to hear from potential users and stakeholders. 

It was vital that I had a strong understanding of the project in order to confidently convey our ideas and to effectively answer questions. I feel that my participation in the user research was the key to this as I was able to understand why we had built things in a certain way.

## Conclusion

This was my most enjoyable project to date for many different reasons. Primarily, I enjoyed working in a great team and learning more about the different aspects of project development. I also felt more invested in making a great service because of my direct interactions with the users. Finally, it felt great to be working on something important and to know that this work could potentially stop people coming to harm from unsafe products.
