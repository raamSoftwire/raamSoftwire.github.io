## Introduction

This project was working with the [Government Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy) to provide a consumer-facing digital consumer energy advice service. The website targets a very broad audience and aims to provide tailored advice for different scenarios. 

![Typical question of the site](/img/esas/question.png)

It presents a set of questions to the user and then provides practical advice for a given situation. During early stage user research it became very clear that very different advice is needed for different consumers. For example, if you are living in a rented property the energy saving measures you are able to carry out are very different to if you own the property and you are able to replace the boiler or install solar panels.

After the energy saving measures are presented there is also information about government grants to help you with financial assistance and links to trusted tradespeople in your area who are able to carry out the work.

## Architecture

The frontend is an AngularJS app with Typescript, which sits on top of a WordPress site supported by a Java service layer. The Wordpress site is used as a content management system, allowing our client to regularly update the content of the site, without having to write any code. The Java and WordPress components are hosted on the [GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS)](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/), a cloud-hosting platform built by the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service). 

![Architecture diagram for the project](/img/esas/architecture.png){:height="600px"}


On the site, once a user has completed the questionnaire they are presented with a list of suggestions based on their answers. This information is provided through an API supported by the [Building Research Establishment (BRE)](https://www.bre.co.uk/energy). 

We also used the [OpenEPC Data API](https://epc.opendatacommunities.org/docs/api) in our service, to look up the energy performance certificate (EPC) for a given property based on its postcode. Below is the function which is responsible for making the HTTP GET request from the API.

{% highlight typescript linenos %}
getEpcsForPostcode(postcode: string): Observable<Epc[]> {
    if (!this.epcs[postcode]) {
        const params = new HttpParams()
            .set('postcode', postcode)
            .set('size', EpcApiService.MAX_NUMBER_OF_EPCS_PER_RESPONSE.toString());
        this.epcs[postcode] = this.http
            .get(this.epcSearchEndpoint, {params: params})
            .map((result: JsonApiResponse<EpcResponse>) => EpcParserService.parse(result))
            .map(epcs => this.getMostRecentEpcs(epcs))
            .shareReplay(1);
    }
    return this.epcs[postcode];
}
{% endhighlight %}

This information was then surfaced on our site in a user-friendly way as shown here.

## Key Features

### Legacy Code

When I joined this team, the project was in the private beta phase. This meant that a version of the site was already live and made available to a select group of users in order to carry out user testing. At this stage, almost all of the heavy lifting was complete in terms of the infrastructure and there were mature designs for almost all of the features.

This was my first time picking up an existing codebase rather than starting with a greenfield project. This was a very different experience for me as there was a huge amount of unfamilar code to get my head around. On the previous projects, because I had seen it grow, I had an understanding of all of the different components and services, and of why we had chosen to do things in a certain way. But on this project, I had to accept that it would just take some time before I was comfortable with the codebase in the same way. I also made sure to ask lots of questions to the other developers who helped build the existing site, in order to get up to speed as quickly as possible.

### Responsive Design

My main focus on this project was to modify the existing website to make it responsive, so that it would be user-friendly on mobile and tablet devices. In software development, it is best-practice to design _Mobile First_, since there is a lot less screen space to play with. This helps to avoid the problem of having to shoe-horn larger layouts or components onto a smaller screen as an after thought.

However, on this project during the alpha and beta test phases there was a very strong focus on user research. This meant that lots of different features and layouts were tried out before concrete decisions were made. This meant that it was not worth designing both desktop and mobile versions for components until they had made it through testing.

![The desktop layout for the homepage](/img/esas/responsiveDesktop.png)

Once the designs were ready for development, we had to update the stylesheets to have different behaviour depending on the user's screen size. We did this using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), a CSS extension, with mixins that allow you to make groups of CSS declarations that you can reuse throughout your site. Below are the mixins we defined along with the breakpoints between the different screen sizes. 

{% highlight scss linenos %}

$max-mobile-breakpoint: 600px;
$max-tablet-breakpoint: 992px;
$min-large-desktop-breakpoint: 1260px;

@mixin mobile() {
  @media (max-width: $max-mobile-breakpoint) {
    @content;
  }
}

@mixin tablet() {
  @media (min-width: ($max-mobile-breakpoint + 1px)) and (max-width: $max-tablet-breakpoint) {
    @content;
  }
}

@mixin desktop() {
  @media (min-width: ($max-tablet-breakpoint + 1px)) {
    @content;
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

In each stylesheet we would start with styles that were common to all screen sizes, like colors and fonts, then declare the different styles for each size by including a mixin and any specific styling, such as flexbox properties, margin and padding. 

{% highlight scss linenos %}
// Example .scss file

// common styles here

@include mobile() {
    // mobile specific styles here
}
@include tablet() {
    // table specific styles here
}
@include desktop() {
    // desktop specific styles here
}

{% endhighlight %}

In particular, we had to focus on how components on the page would wrap or stack into more compact layouts. Shown below is the homepage on a mobile device, comparing this to the desktop version above you can see how the four main buttons have wrapped around to create a more user-friendly mobile experience.

### Chrome Debugging Tools

The Chrome development tools were exetremely useful for working with styling and for diagnosing CSS issues. The tools are found by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+I` in any Chrome window, and they give you access to the HTML and CSS code that is being rendered (amongst lots of other very useful information). This allowed us to reach in and understand any unexpected behaviour when we were trying to problem-solve and debug our code.

A particularly useful feature is the ability to select an element by pressing `Crtl+Shift+C` and clicking on any element on the page. This brings up the dev tools and jumps straight to the code for the selected element, as shown in the image above. You are also able to simulate different devices from within your browser to see what the site would look like on mobiles and tablets of different shapes and sizes ([instructions here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/emulate-mobile-viewports#viewport-controls)).

### Setting Up Ongoing Support

Once the project was complete, I was responsible for handing the site over to our dedicated support team. This involved working closely with the team to help get them set up on our development enviroment and to set up an instance of the database. This also involved transferring accounts, secret keys and responsibilities for the different services we used. This was a good time to reflect on the existing documentation and to improve it whenever questions would arise.

### Standing Desk

During this project I started using a [Varidesk](https://uk.varidesk.com/en-gb/home) which allowed me to switch between sitting and standing at my computer. I had become increasingly aware of my tendency to slouch and I wanted to be more proactive about my posture, since I was spending so much of my time at my desk.

![My standing desk](/img/mspsds/standingDesk.jpg)

It definitely took some getting used to, and so I started by standing for half a day at a time. But it quickly started feeling more natural and I noticed that I had better posture and less tension in my neck and shoulders. I would highly recommend a Varidesk to anyone that has wanted to try a standing desk but doesn't want to commit to standing all day.

## Conclusion

I'm really proud of the work we did on this project and it was great to know that the site could go on to help thousands of people across the country. The end result can be found at [simpleenergyadvice.org.uk](https://www.simpleenergyadvice.org.uk/). If you do check it out, maybe try using the Chrome dev tools to see how it looks on different devices.
