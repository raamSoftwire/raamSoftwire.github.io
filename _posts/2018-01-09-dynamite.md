## Introduction

The brief for this project was to build a platform where players could upload bots to play matches of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Waterbomb, Dynamite, an extension of the classic game against each other. This game was chosen because it is relatively straightforward for players to code a bot and to start playing. 

In the game, rock, paper and scissors follow the traditional rules. Dynamite beats all three of these moves, but the player is limited to a hundred sticks of dynamite. Waterbombs beat dynamite, but lose to everything else. In a match, the bots continue to play until one player reaches a thousand points, where each game is worth one point, and in the case of a tie, the points are rolled over to the next round.

## Architecture

An important part of the initial brief was to allow players to play bots against each other that were written in different programming languages. This meant we had to think very carefully about the architecture for our platform.

We chose to write the front-end, client facing website in ReactJS, because it is a very well supported and documented javascript framework. We built a master server, in NodeJS, to manage the different components of our platform and to act as the back-end for the website. We chose to write this server in NodeJS since we had a lot of experience in the team, and we decided it would be easier to keep everything within the javascript ecosystem.

We built individual runner servers for the different programming languages we chose to support. These servers were responsible for accessing the bot store, which held the bots uploaded by users, then creating an instance of the bots required when a game was to be played. During our time on the project we built runner servers in NodeJS and Java. It has since been extended by other developers to support C# and Python too.

During a game, instances of the bots would pick one of the five available moves (R, P, S, W, D), and send it as a string to the master server. By doing so, it meant that the master server could compare the strings and decide a winner for that move, whilst being agnostic about the language that was used to produce the string. This setup meant that we were able to play bots written in different languages against each other. The master server would then send back information as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to the runner servers about the current gamestate, so that the bots could decide what to play next. 

We used a MySQL database to store match records and user information. We used Amazon Web Services to host our servers, the bot store and our database. 

## Key Features

### Code Style and Code Review

We wrote the code in IntelliJ IDEA, and the technical lead enforced clear guidelines on code style. We used Gitlab for source control, which allowed us to form different branches within the code base. Whilst we were developing new features, we would work on separate branches, which would then be merged into the master branch after a code review was carried out by the technical lead. We used Crucible for code reviews, which provided a good platform for leaving comments on code and clearly seeing differences between different versions of a file as it is being worked on.

### Game Logic

We wrote a lot of the game logic on the master server using variables, arrays and conditional logic. This is a function that takes in an array of the two playersâ€™ moves and updates their scores accordingly.

```
updateScore(moves) {
    if (moves[1] === moves[2]) {
        this.nextRoundPoints += 1;
        return;
    }
    if (
        (moves[1] === 'D' && moves[2] !== 'W') ||
        (moves[1] === 'W' && moves[2] === 'D') ||
        (moves[1] === 'R' && moves[2] === 'S') ||
        (moves[1] === 'S' && moves[2] === 'P') ||
        (moves[1] === 'P' && moves[2] === 'R') ||
        (moves[1] !== 'D' && moves[2] === 'W')
    ) {
        this.score[1] += this.nextRoundPoints;
    } else {
        this.score[2] += this.nextRoundPoints;
    }
    this.nextRoundPoints = 1;

}
```
