## Introduction

The brief for this project was to build a platform where players could upload bots to play matches of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Waterbomb, Dynamite, an extension of the classic game against each other. This game was chosen because it is relatively straightforward for players to code a bot and to start playing. 

In the game, rock, paper and scissors follow the traditional rules. Dynamite beats all three of these moves, but the player is limited to a hundred sticks of dynamite. Waterbombs beat dynamite, but lose to everything else. In a match, the bots continue to play until one player reaches a thousand points, where each game is worth one point, and in the case of a tie, the points are rolled over to the next round.

## Architecture

An important part of the initial brief was to allow players to play bots against each other that were written in different programming languages. This meant we had to think very carefully about the architecture for our platform.

![Our initial architecture design](/img/dynamite/whiteboardArchitecture.png)

We chose to write the front-end, client facing website in ReactJS, because it is a very well supported and documented javascript framework. We built a master server, in NodeJS, to manage the different components of our platform and to act as the back-end for the website. We chose to write this server in NodeJS since we had a lot of experience in the team, and we decided it would be easier to keep everything within the javascript ecosystem.

We built individual runner servers for the different programming languages we chose to support. These servers were responsible for accessing the bot store, which held the bots uploaded by users, then creating an instance of the bots required when a game was to be played. During our time on the project we built runner servers in NodeJS and Java. It has since been extended by other developers to support C# and Python too.

During a game, instances of the bots would pick one of the five available moves (R, P, S, W, D), and send it as a string to the master server. By doing so, it meant that the master server could compare the strings and decide a winner for that move, whilst being agnostic about the language that was used to produce the string. This setup meant that we were able to play bots written in different languages against each other. The master server would then send back information as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to the runner servers about the current gamestate, so that the bots could decide what to play next. 

We used a MySQL database to store match records and user information. We used Amazon Web Services to host our servers, the bot store and our database. 

## Key Features

### Code Style and Code Review

We wrote the code in IntelliJ IDEA, and the technical lead enforced clear guidelines on code style. We used Gitlab for source control, which allowed us to form different branches within the code base. Whilst we were developing new features, we would work on separate branches, which would then be merged into the master branch after a code review was carried out by the technical lead. We used Crucible for code reviews, which provided a good platform for leaving comments on code and clearly seeing differences between different versions of a file as it is being worked on.

### Game Logic

We wrote a lot of the game logic on the master server using variables, arrays and conditional logic. This is a function that takes in an array of the two playersâ€™ moves and updates their scores accordingly.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
updateScore(moves) {
    if (moves[1] === moves[2]) {
        this.nextRoundPoints += 1;
        return;
    }
    if (
        (moves[1] === 'D' && moves[2] !== 'W') ||
        (moves[1] === 'W' && moves[2] === 'D') ||
        (moves[1] === 'R' && moves[2] === 'S') ||
        (moves[1] === 'S' && moves[2] === 'P') ||
        (moves[1] === 'P' && moves[2] === 'R') ||
        (moves[1] !== 'D' && moves[2] === 'W')
    ) {
        this.score[1] += this.nextRoundPoints;
    } else {
        this.score[2] += this.nextRoundPoints;
    }
    this.nextRoundPoints = 1;

}
{% endhighlight %}

Automated testing was an important part of our development approach. It meant that we were able to refactor our code or add new features without unduly worrying about the effect on the existing codebase. Below are the corresponding set of unit tests for the `updateScore` function shown above.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
describe('updateScore', () => {

        it('does nothing in a drawn round', () => {
            game.score[2] = 5;
            game.updateGamestate({1: 'D', 2: 'D'});
            game.updateGamestate({1: 'R', 2: 'R'});
            game.score[1].should.equal(0);
            game.score[2].should.equal(5);
        });

        it('increments the round winner\'s score by nextRoundPoints', () => {
            game.updateScore({1: 'D', 2: 'R'});
            game.score[1].should.equal(1);
            game.score[2].should.equal(0);
            game.updateScore({1: 'W', 2: 'R'});
            game.score[1].should.equal(1);
            game.score[2].should.equal(1);
            game.updateScore({1: 'D', 2: 'W'});
            game.score[1].should.equal(1);
            game.score[2].should.equal(2);
            game.nextRoundPoints = 3;
            game.updateScore({1: 'S', 2: 'P'});
            game.score[1].should.equal(4);
            game.score[2].should.equal(2);
        });

        it('increments nextRoundPoints in case of a draw', () => {
            game.updateScore({1: 'D', 2: 'D'});
            game.nextRoundPoints.should.equal(2);
            game.updateScore({1: 'R', 2: 'R'});
            game.nextRoundPoints.should.equal(3);
        });

        it('resets nextRoundPoints after a non-drawn round', () => {
            game.updateScore({1: 'D', 2: 'D'});
            game.updateScore({1: 'D', 2: 'R'});
            game.nextRoundPoints.should.equal(1);
            game.updateScore({1: 'D', 2: 'R'});
            game.nextRoundPoints.should.equal(1);
        });

    });
{% endhighlight %}

### Database

We set up a MySQL database for storing user details along with details about bots, matches and tournaments. We also set up a SQLite database to run in memory for use during testing. When we built the database we had to carefully consider the schema and the fields to be included for each table. Below is an image showing the configuration of the Bots table, showing the fields that we used along with their types and other properties.

### The Frontend

We wrote the frontend in ReactJS, HTML5 and Sass. We provided a user interface for players to upload or update bots and then to play them against each other. The users were also able to see all of their bots and delete them if required. This functionality required us to access the database from the frontend, which we did via the master server.

### Login

We made a simple login page where users can login or create new accounts. These login details were then stored in the database along with some of the match results. We were careful to hash and salt the passwords to make sure they were properly encrypted, which meant that they were never stored in plain text in our database.

### Documentation

In order to help users writing bots as a quickly as possible we wrote clear instructions on the front page of the website. This included example blocks of code and downloadable examples to help people get started.
